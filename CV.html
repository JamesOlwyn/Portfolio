            <h2><u>Interests</u></h2>
            <p>I have many personal interests. I enjoy hiking and biking in and outside of hamilton when I get 
               the chance. Ever since I was young I have loved to cook up a storm in the kitchen and that passion 
               has never dulled. It is my opinion that healthy living starts with what you eat. I am an avid archer 
               and on weekends I love to practice. It taught me to focus and to have patience. The effort Iâ€™ve put in definitely paid off.
            </p>
            <p>I am always willing to learn something new because once its learnt it sticks with me.</p>
			<p>I relish leadership opportunities when given a chance during my study I have filled the student representative position during two different qualifications and I have coordinated my classes' social media.</p>

            <h2><u>Future Goals</u></h2>
            <p>I aim to further my knowledge by getting actual work experience in the field. 
               I have never been one for classes. I prefer active experience in the workplace. Learning as I go.
            </p>
            <p>I aim to work with academic institutions to create programs aimed 
               at encouraging teens to explore photography and technology as a viable career path. 
            </p>
            <p>In the future, I would like to create my on website building company that utilizes my passions of
               I.T. graphic desgin and Photography. 
            </p>
            <p>A smaller goal for myself over the next year is to take the knowledge I am learning and combine it with my 
               photography. What form that might take I am unsure of but very motivated to find out. 
            </p>

            <h2><u>Personal Objectives</u></h2>
            <p>This year I aim to improve my productivity. as I have a habit of getting sucked into other tasks I have created a timetable I update 
               frequently. I have also been making a considerable effort to think through my tasks before getting too far into them. so far it has helped.
            <p>This year I have been trying to improve my leadership. to do that I have volunteered to become a student rep essentially acting as a voice for my class. 
               Also, I took the leadership role in the business fundamentals assignment. I believe that going forward into my professional career, this skill will be essential.
